An article in the November 2015 Communications of the ACM, ["Why People Post Benevolent and Malicious Comments Online](http://cacm.acm.org/magazines/2015/11/193324-why-people-post-benevolent-and-malicious-comments-online/abstract)", features inspired images, from French Illustrator / Vector Artist / Videographer "[NLShop](http://www.shutterstock.com/g/00nl)" ([http://www.shutterstock.com/g/00nl](http://www.shutterstock.com/g/00nl)).

Out of context, the above image represents an evocative way to portray how I view my personal relationship with computing, from time-to-time. Ouch, my face! : o )  
  
In context, the article, and this image, deal with the topic of bullying and othe inappropriate online behavior. It's a topic worthy of serious discussion and I welcome its inclusion in the CACM.
