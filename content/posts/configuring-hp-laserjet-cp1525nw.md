Found myself configuring out network printer again, so recording for future reference:  
  

*   Connect printer to router via network cable
*   Power on the printer
*   Use menu "Reports" to discover the IP address of the printer
*   Connect to that IP address via web browser
*   Configure wireless settings
*   Disconnect the network cable from the printer
*   Reconfigure any printer settings on client devices
