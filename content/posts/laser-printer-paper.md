My [HP LaserJet 4500DN](http://h20000.www2.hp.com/bizsupport/TechSupport/Home.jsp?locale=en_US&prodTypeId=18972&prodSeriesId=25505&lang=en&cc=us) routinely curls-up the [20-lb. Multi-Purpose Paper](http://www.gp.com/officeproducts/generalusecopier.html) I have been feeding it. The paper ends-up not guiding into the fuser properly, bringing the printer to a loud, electronically-buzzing, full-on 13.01.00-error halt. This might happen four times during a nine-page job, especially when using the duplexer. I bought a ten-ream box of the 20-lb. Georgia-Pacific paper in the late 1990's, and I still have four reams left in my printer stand. :P  
  
Tonight I tried feeding my printer [28-lb. Paper](http://h10010.www1.hp.com/wwpc/us/en/sm/WF06c/A10-12771-215517-322562-322562-77947-77958-77959.html?jumpid=reg_R1002_USEN), and no problems for four continuous duplexed black-and-white pages. :) I am feeling cautiously optimistic. Not having to regularly open the transfer-belt drawer, remove the transfer-belt, grab a curled piece of paper from the guts of my printer, and wait 90 seconds while the printer re-warms-up would be a welcome relief, even if a ream of 28-lb. paper costs [$10](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00008XPOU/103-4101284-1200610?SubscriptionId=1CFPMXXAJP3FRHMFF882&n=1064954).  
  
Check out the price difference for one ream of 28-lb. paper (HPL285R) between HP's web site ($71.91) and Amazon.com/Office Depot ($9.99) via the links above. Only explanations I can come up with is that HP doesn't want to sell 28-lb. paper, or they only want to sell paper when they can get a seven-fold markup.

I'm not sure why you'd want to go all the way to 105 g/m2 (28 lb) paper. My Xerox DocuPrint N32 does very well with 90 g/m2 (24 lb) MaxBrite laser paper (from OfficeMax -- where else?).  
  
I've never even tried using 75 g/m2 (20 lb).

I bought it out of a Kinko's sale bin. :) So that's all I have available. And for $10/ream, it sounds reasonable.
