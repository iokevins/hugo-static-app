Saw a [Favr](http://favr.us/) car, while grocery shopping.  
  
From a March 2015 article, in the Santa Cruz Tech Beat:  
  
"Founded in Santa Cruz by locals, Clark Brigham and Scott Gallucci, the app launched this week in Santa Cruz and will roll out in the Bay Area and New York in the coming weeks."
