As a former HP employee, I felt surprise when I noticed today that Nora Denzel left HP in Dec 2005, the same time I did.  
  
Nora was one of the earliest management podcasters at HP, and one of the first management bloggers, a real trailblazer. I had a fun exchange in the comments of one of her podcasts with Nora's sister (I have forgotten the exact context), who discovered my post and Nora's blog by chance and upbraided Nora playfully for not telling her about her blog. Fun. :)
