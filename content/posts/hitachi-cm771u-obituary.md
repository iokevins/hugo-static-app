This evening my 19-inch [Hitachi](http://www.hitachi.us/) CM771U CRT Color Monitor, serial number V0G007387, born in Tijuana, Mexico in July 2000, exhibited non-recoverable [electron gun](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electron_gun) malfunction. It was six (in human years). Over it's lifetime it displayed Windows 98, HP-UX, Red Hat, Debian, Ubuntu, Windows XP, and finally Debian again.  
  
Due to high-voltage innards, I won't be taking it apart like the Braun motorized [toothbrush](http://schultkl.blogspot.com/2006/05/power-toothbrush-replacement-after-12.html).

It is succeeded by a [NEC MultiSync 90GXÂ²](http://www.necdisplay.com/products/ProductDetail.cfm?Product=437&ClassificationFamily=2&Classification=1&ProductGroup=LCD) 19-inch LCD monitor, recommended by [Wize.com](http://wize.com/monitors/reviews/nec-multisync-90gx2-silver-black-19-lcd-monitor).
