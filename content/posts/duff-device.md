While in class this evening someone mentioned [Duff's Device](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Duff%27s_Device). It still blows my mind but after reading [this walkthrough](http://www.codemaestro.com/reviews/review00000102.html) I understand how it works.  
  
From the article:  
  
Duff's device is still considered to be the fastest code to copy memory to a device for over 22 years.
