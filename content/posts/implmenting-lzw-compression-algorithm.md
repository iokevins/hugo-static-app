Today I am implementing the [LZW data compression algorithm](http://www.dspguide.com/ch27/5.htm) as a toy project.  
  
LZW stands for Lempel, Ziv, and Welch, its creators. It was the first widely used universal data compression method on computers.  
  
Its popularity led it to be included in many file formats people use every day: [GIF](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GIF) and [TIFF](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TIFF) images, [PDF](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PDF) files, and [files sent to your printer](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PostScript#PostScript_Level_2).
