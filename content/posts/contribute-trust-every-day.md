Something I can immediately use: "Contribute trust every day" 

> "Physical teams suffer from physical barriers (such as a floor for each department) which consequently create tribes and ultimately compartmentalize trust. Amazingly though, physical teams are still able to operate even with weakened trust. 

> Remote teams, however, live and die by their trust. For remote teams, there are no walls, there are no tribes, there are no executives on the 5th floor, there’s no one watching over your shoulder, and there’s no one babysitting you. It’s simply individuals bound by trust with one common goal."
