Investigating how to port TextFX to Geany  
  
NOTEPAD++  
[Source Code](http://svn.tuxfamily.org/viewvc.cgi/notepadplus_repository/trunk/)  
[Plugins HOWTO](http://docs.notepad-plus-plus.org/index.php?title=Plugin_Development)  
[Plugin Central](http://docs.notepad-plus-plus.org/index.php?title=Plugin_Central)  
[TextFX official site](http://textfx.no-ip.com/textfx/)  
[Initial release](http://sourceforge.net/p/notepad-plus/discussion/482781/thread/118b683d)  
  
NOTEPAD++ NOTES  

*   "This plugin has no maintainer and wants one; please see [TextFX's Future](http://docs.notepad-plus-plus.org/index.php/TextFX%27s_Future)"
*   "Currently, some plugins are taking over some areas where TextFX is being used:

*   Code alignment
*   NppConverter
*   XBrackets Lite
*   Tidy2"

*   "The npp-plugins project features the v0.25 sources and the v0.26 binaries (\[v0.26\] changes are not deemed to be publcly available as sources by their author.)"

ANALYSIS  
  
So...it seems TextFX represents abandonware, last updated in 2009, and current strategy involves piecing it out into separate plugins. Which seems to imply the same strategy, for Geany.  
  
VERDICT  
  
Wait and see
