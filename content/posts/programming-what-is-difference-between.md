*   A programmer knows how to program computers.
*   A developer is a programmer who sits in a cubicle and gets paid for it.
*   A coder is a programmer who sits on a beanbag listening to techno in a black T-shirt and gets paid for it.
*   An architect is a programmer who thinks up something really big for the other programmers to program, and gets paid for it
*   A consultant was a programmer, but now wears a suit and tells developers, coders, and architects how they ought to develop, code and architect, and gets paid a lot for it.
