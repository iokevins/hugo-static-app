Sunday:  

1.  Reviewed the [Google C++ Style Guide](http://code.google.com/p/google-styleguide/) for formatting, naming, and comment considerations.
2.  Adiemus' "Adiemus" from their album "Songs of Sanctuary"
3.  Installed [Valgrind](http://valgrind.org/) suite of profiling and debugging.
4.  Installed [kcachegrind](http://kcachegrind.sourceforge.net/) which provides "visual support for the cachegrind skin of the memory analyzer Valgrind."
5.  Ludovico Einaudi's "Passagio" from his album "Le Onde"
6.  Implemented ToString() using std::ostringstream code from [http://bytes.com/forum/thread62153.html](http://bytes.com/forum/thread62153.html)
7.  Very cool: this mimics Java's "public final static" class feature: "newl\_parser::parser::token::NUMBER". Namespace "newl\_parser" contains class "parser" which contains public struct "token", the public struct containing enumerated type "yyTokenType" which (finally) contains all token types (for example, NUMBER, IDENTIFIER, ASSIGN).
