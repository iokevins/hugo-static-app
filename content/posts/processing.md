Today's bad joke is brought to you by GS Technology, LLC.  
  
On Saturday, Dawn and I ordered a new processor for her computer because her chip fan died, overheating the old one (we believe).  
  
So the joke is (brace yourself)...the order status for the processor is currently "Processing." x\_x  
  
Dawn adds, "Processing slowly."
