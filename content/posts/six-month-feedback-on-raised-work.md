I wrote this feedback for my raised work-surface at my place of employment; adapting to share my thoughts with the general public. I raised my work-surface in April, 2011.

**Six Month Feedback on Raised Work-Surface**

  

·**General Feedback**

oI suggest a strategy of standing _and_ sitting:

§I stand for two hours, then sit for two hours

§Adjust as needed (sit more if tired, and so forth)

oPer above, I suggest you obtain a chair with proper ergonomic seat height (see “Suggested Equipment,” below)

oOccasionally, I still feel some light back soreness—but I would never go back to sitting all day, given the choice

oFood for thought, only—electric or hydraulic height-adjustable desks would allow for variable work-surface heights throughout the day

·**Installation**

oI raised two work surfaces and left one lower, which allows a bit more room to spread papers and such, and looks a bit cleaner

oFace monitors toward a low-traffic area, to minimize passer-by distractions/eye-contact

oBefore the movers arrive, make it easy for them by moving all objects off of the desk, disconnect any cables, remove things from walls, and so forth, as needed

oSet work-surface height at distance from 90-degree elbows to the floor

oMonitor at time of installation, to properly set the ergonomic work-surface height (critical):

§Take a tape measurement from the floor to your 90-degree elbow to determine the ergonomic desk height

§After installing the work-surface, confirm the height (for example, place an unplugged keyboard on top and verify ergonomic arm position)

§A bit low work-surface height is better than a bit high work-surface height, as you can always fine-tune height increase (for example, standing on a mat)

§Surface height should feel comfortable!

·**Standing “Pros”**

oStanding eliminates post-lunch lethargy, for me

oI perceive an increased focus while standing

oI still feel a bit of back soreness while standing, from time to time—standing helps but is not a miracle solution

oSome argue standing is good for dieting as it burns more calories than sitting:[http://lifehacker.com/5798791/calculate-how-many-calories-you-can-burn-if-you-switch-to-a-standing-desk](https://owa.cde.ca.gov/owa/redir.aspx?C=0fe0a06b5acd40e9bc5ed2ca5dc6622a&URL=http%3a%2f%2flifehacker.com%2f5798791%2fcalculate-how-many-calories-you-can-burn-if-you-switch-to-a-standing-desk)

·**Standing “Cons”**

oStanding all day, like sitting all day, is hard on the body, but in different ways—to compensate, alternate between standing or sitting, and take breaks, walk around, and so forth

oShorter colleagues may find a high work-surface challenging during desk-side meetings (a good reason to keep at least one lower work-surface)

·**Suggested Equipment**

oFoot rest

oAnti-fatigue mat

oChair with ergonomic seat height

§A short-term work-around: adjust existing 30” stool with reams of paper until 90-degree elbows (while seated)

§Chair options: foot-rest, seat back
