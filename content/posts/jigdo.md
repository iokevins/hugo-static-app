[Jigdo](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jigdo) ([portmanteau](http://dictionary.com/browse/portmanteau) of "Jigsaw" and "download") solves the problem of mirror sites maintaining CD and DVD ISOs by downloading all the files in the ISO and then creating the ISO on the client computer. Clever. ;) I'm using it tonight to download the latest testing version of Debian. I only wish I knew how to pronounce it. :)
