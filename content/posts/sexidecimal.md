While reading about the history of hexadecimal this evening on [Wikipedia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hexadecimal), I noted that IBM decided early on that the proper term sexadecimal was too risqu√©. So they renamed sexadecimal to hexadecimal--the rest is history.  
  
I guess the same principle works for hexagon and sexagon.
