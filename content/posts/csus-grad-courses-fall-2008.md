As a student taking graduate-level classes through the [CSUS Open University](http://www.cce.csus.edu/programs/openuniversity.htm) program, I have these class options to choose from for Fall 2008 (assuming I can waive the prerequisite CSC 205 course--which requires fully classified status to take):  

1.  CSC 239 ([Chang W.](http://gaia.csus.edu/%7Echangw/)). Advanced Operating Systems Principles and Design. (AVAILABLE FALL 2008; PRE: CSC-205)
2.  CSC 242 ([Arad B.](http://gaia.ecs.csus.edu/%7Earad/)). Computer-Aided Systems Design and Verification. (AVAILABLE FALL 2008; PRE: CSC-205)
3.  CSC 255 ([Ghansah I.](http://gaia.ecs.csus.edu/%7Eghansahi/)). Computer Networks. (AVAILABLE FALL 2008; PRE: CSC-138)
4.  CSC 273 ([Arad B.](http://gaia.ecs.csus.edu/%7Earad/)). Hierarchical Digital Design Methodology. (AVAILABLE FALL 2008; PRE: CSC-205)

The other graduate-level classes offered:  

1.  CSC 201. Programming Language Principles.
2.  CSC 204. Data Models for Database Management Systems.
3.  CSC 205. Computer Systems Structure.
4.  CSC 206. Algorithms and Paradigms
5.  CSC 209. Research Methodology
6.  CSC 233. Advanced Software Engineering Project Management.
7.  CSC 234. Software Verification and Validation.
8.  CSC 235. Software Architecture.
9.  CSC 252. Cryptography Theory and Practice.
10.  CSC 254. Network Security.  
    
11.  CSC 280. Advanced Computer Architecture.

require fully-classified graduate level status. CSUS might offer waivers--I'm not sure yet.  
  
Two other classes that seem interesting:  

1.  CSC 133. Computer Graphics
2.  CSC 165. Computer Game Architecture

On [Rate My Professors](http://ratemyprofessors.com/ShowRatings.jsp?tid=890859), [W. Chang](http://gaia.csus.edu/%7Echangw/) he gets a 2.1--but only from undergrad-courses. The web site fails to list any other professors. Helpfully, his web site shows a Mac icon beating down a Windows icon. The web site fails to list anything about Arad or Ghansah.  
  
[PickAProf.com](http://www.pickaprof.com/) rocks--it lists the grades given by a prof. It doesn't seem as popular though, in terms of reviews, even though it started in 2000.
