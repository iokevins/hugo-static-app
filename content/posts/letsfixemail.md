An important [post](https://www.campaignmonitor.com/blog/post/4341/inbox-from-google-gmail-media-queries-and-css-support-inbox-love) on the state of e-mail HTML/CSS support across various e-mail clients today and how the industry might come together to improve the experience for everyone.  
  

*   Support [media queries](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Media_queries)
*   E-mail client preprocessors and varying ways they modify the HTML during the sanitization proces
*   E-mail client rendering engines do not support CSS consistently
*   E-mail client development teams do not collaborate
*   Iframes do not work due to resource demands of full-blown web browser support
