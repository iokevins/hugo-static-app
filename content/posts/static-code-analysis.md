A strong opinion on adopting **static code analysis** (highlighting added; full article, below):  

> The **most important thing I have done** as a programmer in recent years is to aggressively pursue static code analysis. Even more valuable than the hundreds of serious bugs I have prevented with it is the change in mindset about the way I view software reliability and code quality.  
>   
> …I feel the success that we have had with code analysis has been clear enough that I will say plainly **it is irresponsible to not use it**.
