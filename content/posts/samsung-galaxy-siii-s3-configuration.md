    *   Fix the viewer/S3 issue:
    
    *   Upper right > Settings
    *   Switch Viewer
    *   On a separate page, use this QR code image: ![](https://a.thumbs.redditmedia.com/f6oSxVEG8B-UhPULSsa9KQ45uzXCOvnS1bptzgGO0c8.jpg)
    *   This loads viewer "for the Galaxy S3" from Tiny VR Screen Fix
    *   Note: "Google Cardboard has a weird problem with some (but not all!) Samsung Galaxy S3 phones where it displays the image really tiny and at the bottom of the screen. This pretty much makes it impossible to use it."...I thought it was me, but no, it's not, just some weird issue
