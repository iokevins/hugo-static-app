I've noticed this past month that some web sites enforce insecure passwords--even financial web sites!  
  
Bruce Schneier writes about choosing an appropriately secure password [here](http://www.wired.com/politics/security/commentary/securitymatters/2007/01/72458?currentPage=all), capturing what the latest and greatest password crackers check for.  
  
Some web sites fail to allow secure passwords for one of the following technical reasons:  

*   Only accept alpha-numeric passwords
*   Passwords limited to x digits

Lame!
