In July I undervolted my X1 Carbon Gen 2 using Intel Extreme Tuning Utility v6.5.2.40, in an attempt to cool temperatures and preserve battery life:

*   Core voltage offset: -0.070 V (-70 mV)

Note: to see all menu options, select menu item "Show All" in the upper-right.

  

However, when under load since then, my laptop has had multiple Blue Screens of Death (BSOD) with Windows 10 error WHEA\_UNCORRECTABLE\_ERROR.

  

Tonight I halved the undervolt:

*   Core voltage offset: -0.035 V (-35 mV)

Will follow-up if further changes needed.
