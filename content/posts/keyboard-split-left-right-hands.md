Looking at various models:  
  
Kineses Freestyle2 (20-inch)  
[Î¼TRON Keyboard](http://xahlee.info/kbd/uTRON_keyboard.html) from Japan  
[Ergodox keyboard](http://xahlee.info/kbd/ergodox_keyboard.html) (DIY)  
  
(?)  
  
Thinking separating the keyboard hands will help with trapezius strain, which has hurt since Sep 2013. Inspired after reading this [post](http://kadavy.net/blog/posts/split-keyboard/) by David Kadavy.
