Just now understand the double meaning...the HP split leaves the printer business within company "HP Inc.", which seems reasonable, considering they make profit off their ink.  
  
I used to work in the enterprise division, so that goes to the new company, HPE, or HP Enterprise. It has a new logo:

Also: "If a building is split between the two companies, there will be separate entrances." which applies to Roseville, California.
