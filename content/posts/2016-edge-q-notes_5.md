[Manuscript](http://edge.org/responses/what-do-you-consider-the-most-interesting-recent-scientific-news-what-makes-it): "2016 : WHAT DO YOU CONSIDER THE MOST INTERESTING RECENT \[SCIENTIFIC\] NEWS? WHAT MAKES IT IMPORTANT?"  
  
My arbitrary notes, collected from reading the responses.  

*   "All of us probably contain replicating cells from more than one member of our genetic family." ([via](http://edge.org/response-detail/26684))
*   "Cooperation for the collective worse is as widespread as cooperation for a better society!" ([via](http://edge.org/response-detail/26791))
*   Hay fever may represent an overcompensation of the immune response, due to the absence of parasites, in part ([via](http://edge.org/response-detail/26768))
*   "Vacuum of space contains 10^-29 grams of invisible matter, or, equivalently, vacuum energy" ([via](http://edge.org/response-detail/26727))

*   Why is it not zero?
*   Why do we live exactly at the time when the energy of empty space is comparable to the energy of normal matter?
*   Is vacuum energy metastable, eventually decaying, locally, while growing, in other locations?
*   Note: UC Berkeley professor Saul Perlmutter won the 2011 Nobel Prize, for his work in this area

*   Steven Pinker, on "Human Progress Quantified" ([via](http://edge.org/response-detail/26616)):

*   Fatalism vs Complacency
*   Quantifying human progress helps avoid falling into either trap

*   Nature: "...discovery of a lymphatic system within the central nervous system." ([via](http://edge.org/response-detail/26698))
*   "...genetic and non-genetic adult augmentation represents hundred-fold larger markets and much faster potential return on enhancement—weeks rather than decades—web-warp-drive speed vs. human generation speed." ([via](http://edge.org/response-detail/26567))
*   Gender and the FAB hypothesis ([via](http://edge.org/response-detail/26654))

1.  They call it the FAB hypothesis—for **field-specific ability beliefs**. It focuses on the belief as to whether success in a particular field requires pure innate brilliance, the kind of raw intellectual power that can’t be taught and for which no amount of conscientious hard work is a substitute.
2.  The strength of the FABs in a particular field predicts the percentage of women in that field more accurately than other leading hypotheses, including field-specific variation in work-life balance and reliance on skills for systematizing vs. empathizing.
3.  "...informal evidence that raises the plausibility of the FAB hypothesis, including the number of fictional male geniuses inhabiting popular culture—from Sherlock Holmes to Dr. House to Will Hunting—compared to the number of female geniuses." (note: I thought up [The Extraordinary Adventures of Adèle Blanc-Sec](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Extraordinary_Adventures_of_Ad%C3%A8le_Blanc-Sec), but the point stands and seems reasonable)

*   Quantum Entanglement Is Independent Of Space And Time ([via](http://edge.org/response-detail/26790)): 

*   "...predictions of quantum mechanics are independent of the relative arrangement in space and time of the individual measurements"
*   What does it mean for particles to "be entangled"?

*   Via: [http://www.livescience.com/28550-how-quantum-entanglement-works-infographic.html](http://www.livescience.com/28550-how-quantum-entanglement-works-infographic.html)
*   "Spin is depicted here as an axis of rotation, but **actual particles do not rotate**" (note: emphasis mine; thank you!)
*   In certain controlled tests, splitting a photon results in two entangled photons
*   Observing the photons, individually, indicates they take up positions (for example, spin) with respect to each other, **regardless of distance between**
*   Pretty spooky, indeed! : o )

*   "We would be well advised to reconsider the foundations of space and time in a conceptual way."
