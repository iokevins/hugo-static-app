Hats off to [Philippe Deschamp](http://www-rocq.inria.fr/qui/Philippe.Deschamp/) (merci) of the [French National Institute for Research in Computer Science and Control](http://www.inria.fr/index.en.html) and [Igor Krassikov](http://kiv.kiev.ua/) (Дякую) for their work on [errata submissions](http://infolab.stanford.edu/%7Eullman/dragon/errata1.html) to the latest [Dragon Book](http://dragonbook.stanford.edu/).  
  
I found an error with the book (page 528) and at first I thought the errata failed to list it--but it turns out I failed to see the link to the original errata list, which contains quite a few errors--mostly errors involving missing semi-colons, braces, extra parenthesis, and so forth.  
  
It turns out that editions printed after Spring 2008 no longer contain the bugs on the first errata sheet--one reason that purchasing a new book might make sense, as it took me some time to go through and annotate my copy.  
  
UPDATE: "Claudio on [comp.compilers](http://groups.google.com/group/comp.compilers) [writes](http://groups.google.com/group/comp.compilers/browse_thread/thread/aba98c2b37c83190/d794d30931eb908e?lnk=gst&q=%22dragon+book%22#d794d30931eb908e) "But I would wait for a reprint. The first print of the 2nd edition has way too many mistakes." Yes.  
  
UPDATE: Dr. Ullman, a co-author of the book, granted me credit for reporting an optimization error in [Figure 9.9, page 594](http://infolab.stanford.edu/%7Eullman/dragon/errata.html). Another student identified the error during class--I identified the photocopied handout as the figure from the book, verified the error failed to exist on the errata, and followed-up with Dr. Ullman. In fairness to the identifier, I'm attempting to figure out their name(s) so they might receive due credit.
