It's hard to say how much this has enriched my life. Thanks to Brian Lavender for sharing it on [SacLUG](http://www.saclug.org/). Screen captures courtesy KSnapshot (very intuitive).  
  
Installation: sudo apt-get install sl  
  
Images  
  
The default ("sl"):  
  
[![](/images/sl320.png)](/images/sl.png)  
  
Note: The default, it travels across the screen from right to left, with animated smoke and wheels.  
  
"-a An accident seems to happen. You’ll feel pity for people who cry for help.":  
[![](/images/sl-help-help320.png)](/images/sl-help-help.png)  
  
Note: the same as the original except it shows two engineers saying "HelpHelp!".  
  
"-l shows little one.":

Note: the same as the original "sl" but it moves from the lower-right to the upper-left.
