The second midterm grades from my class this semester are in; it was [another](http://schultkl.blogspot.com/2009/10/csc-130-first-midterm-exam-grades.html) bloodbath:

Maximum possible points were 100. Out of 56 test takers: 3 earned an A (5%); 8 earned a B (14%); 11 earned a C (20%); 14 earned a D (25%); and 20 earned an F (36%). The test counts for 15% of the final grade.  
  
I earned a 96 on this one. o\_O;;;  
  
One might compare this with the [first](http://schultkl.blogspot.com/2009/10/csc-130-first-midterm-exam-grades.html) midterm exam and find three signs of improvement: (1) failures dropped from 58% to 36%; (2) passing scores (C and up) increased from 22% to 39%; and (3) above average scores (B and up) increased from 11% to 19%.  
  
On the negative side, 61% (3 in 5) earned a D or worse (compared to 79% from the first midterm). Three in five students have been left behind and are unlikely to catch up and "get" this material. :(  
  
The increasing standard deviations between the two tests confirm a greater spread away from the average.  
  
This comment on [SacRate.com](http://sacrate.com/database/search.asp?type=prof&prof=833), however, may provide hope for even these students: "Has a huge curve. I had 47% before the final, got 66/100 and ended up with a B+ after the curve."  
  
Food for thought. :X
