Experienced the same problem as the above link. Not sure why. No email filters, disabled all extensions.  
  
What happens: I spot two emails in the Trash. I move them to the Inbox. Moments later, they get moved to the Trash.  
  
The only thing that stops this from happening: turn off my mobile device.  
  
After a few minutes, turned the mobile device back on--so far so good.
