Dave Winer, on living modestly and feeling happy: "Live a gentle human-size life"  

> "One evening, I was walking around the neighborhood of the office when I met a friend of a friend, let's call him Joe (not his real name) and stopped to chat. I had heard that he was very rich, and asked why he lived in such a modest middle-class neighborhood when he could afford an estate in Los Altos Hills or Portola Valley. He said he preferred to live a modest life, to live within his ability to use his wealth, and just kept the money as a cushion in case something went bad, someone in his family got sick, or some other emergency."
