title: 'Cryptography terminology - Padlock = Public Key'

Cryptography simplified--I _really_ like the idea of calling the public key a _lock_, rather than a key:  

> "So Alice come out with a brilliant solution. Now, she only maintains one key (private key). She distributes the same padlocks (public key) to her friends. Anyone can close the padlocks (encrypt), but only she has the key to open (decrypt) them. Now, anyone can send stuff to Alice using the padlock she distributed, and Alice no longer have to maintain manage different keys for different people."

That is:  

*   Key = private key
*   Lock = public key 

This seems intuitive and clarifies things, for me.  
  
What would it take to make this terminology  mainstream?
