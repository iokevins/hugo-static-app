_Golden slugs to golden bears_

Very proud of Dawn; she will participate in Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory's ([LBNL](http://www.lbl.gov/)) UC-Berkeley Science Undergraduate Laboratory Internship ([SULI](http://csee.lbl.gov/Programs/SULI/index.html)) program this summer. The United States Department of Energy's Office of Workforce Development for Teachers and Scientists (WDTS) administers the program in collaboration with the DOE National Laboratories, which includes the LBNL.  
  
The WDTS pays SULI participants a weekly stipend plus housing allowance plus partial travel reimbursement; not as nice as the full room and board plus stipend offered by [UC-Santa Cruz](http://schultkl.blogspot.com/2012/03/uc-santa-cruz-summer-logistics.html), but...Dawn will still come out quite nicely ahead. Nothing to sneeze at, by any stretch of the imagination. And it really represents Dawn's dream work environment, working with other brilliant minds on advanced technology projects.  
  
We have found at least one housing arrangement next-door to the LBNL which seems a very cozy place to stay for the eight weeks of the project.  
  
Exciting times...will certainly make it easier to visit during the summer.
