Laughed uncontrollably as I watched Jeff Goldblum in the movie Independence Day upload a virus into the alien mother ship's host--Jeff's PowerBook displays "Negotiating With Host", then "Online With Host" followed by the Apple beep, followed by tappity-tappity as he enters about ten lines of code in two seconds, then "Uploading Virus", then a cut to a cent-com operator reporting, "Sir, he's Uploading the Virus", then the cent-com commander reporting, "Eagle One, The Package Is Being Delivered", then cut back to Jeff's PowerBook reporting "Uploading...Upload Complete!!!", and finally Jeff turning to Will Smith and saying, "The Virus Is In."  
  
High camp.
