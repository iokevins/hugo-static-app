Slowly going through the May 2012 "Geek Dad" section and they have a secret code embedded in the package, or section.  
  
The text of the setup reads, "A Secret Page for Parents: Just Crack the Code / Visit wired.com/geekdad/????????. (The eight missing letters are somewhere in this package)."  
  
You can see the package here: [http://www.wired.com/geekdad/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/3190\_GD\_12\_Event\_Guide4.pdf](http://www.wired.com/geekdad/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/3190_GD_12_Event_Guide4.pdf)  
  
Per the package, the solution should read [http://wired.com/geekdad/dadrules/](http://wired.com/geekdad/dadrules/)  
  
But that does not work; it returns page not found.  
  
Instead, you need the www prefix: [http://www.wired.com/geekdad/dadrules/](http://www.wired.com/geekdad/dadrules/)  
  
For the life of me, I must have looked a dozen times through that package before seeing the second picture. I figured out the "rules" suffix almost straightaway...I figured the first image was either "r" for RPG9000 or "d" for Doom...and when I finally tried the former link, above, and found dadrules did not represent the key, I felt a lot of frustration...like maybe they had decided to kill the link after only a month. However, a Google search saved the day ; o )
