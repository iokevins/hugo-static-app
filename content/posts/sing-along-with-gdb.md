While looking for the [GNU Debugger (GDB)](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GDB) [documentation](http://sourceware.org/gdb/current/onlinedocs/gdb.html) I found this link to lyrics people have written for it: [http://sourceware.org/gdb/song/](http://sourceware.org/gdb/song/)  
  
The [filking](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Filk) of the [Bee Gees'](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bee_Gees)  1979 #1 hit Tragedy tickled me. :) Play the [video](http://youtube.com/watch?v=5mTlurY2B3U) in the background while reading the lyrics. ;)
