Using a NETGEAR Fuse Mobile Hotspot to access the local Sprint [LTE](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LTE_(telecommunication)) network, via [The Calyx Institute](https://www.calyxinstitute.org/) 501(c)(3).  
  
Due to our apartment's distance from the nearest exchange, we only have/had ~1.0Mbps, via [Cruzio Velocity + Fusion ADSL](http://cruzio.com/services/broadband/economy/). but now have LTE speeds (much better).  
  
Until Cruzio Fiber-to-the-Home arrives, it seems like we finally have telecommunications sorted, for the first time, in the two years since we've lived in Santa Cruz.

Plan Details:  
  

*   Via [https://www.reddit.com/r/Calyx/comments/97b0fu/recent\_throttling/](https://www.reddit.com/r/Calyx/comments/97b0fu/recent_throttling/) (08/14/2018):

*   Plan code:

*   "30GB Spectrum Mobile Broadband"
*   Not coded as Sprint unlimited

*   Sprint doesn't charge Calyx / Mobile Citizen the listed $15/GB overage

*   Seems like users draw from a wholesale usage bucket of GB
*   Sprint seems to treat this wholesale usage bucket as effectively unlimited (e.g., 999999GB/month) per their lease agreement with Mobile Citizen

*   Deprioritization:

*   Only applies to unlimited plans
*   Not applied to fixed bucket of data plans (e.g., the 30GB plan)

I am considering this solution for my unserved rural home. I am going to have a friend who has Sprint cell service come to do a site survey with his phone. We have excellent AT&T and Verizon coverage so we are hoping Sprint will be acceptable. Can you comment on your experience with Calyx and Sprint service? How are the speeds and latency? Have you done a speed test?  
Thanks for your help.

Here's to hoping you get good Sprint coverage! : ) I have read Sprint does better, in rural areas, but your mileage may vary.  
  
Here's my SpeedTest result, from 10/30/2016:

I'm not sure if it's proper, as SpeedTest recognizes the cellular router as having a phone number out of the midwest, and we're near San Francisco. I picked a server near SF, for the test. Got 6.27 Mb/s down, 4.26 Mb/s up, latency 39 ms.

Thank you for the very fast reply. I do have some options that are faster and way more expensive, but if the site survey works out I am going to pull the trigger on this. Verizon and AT&T test around 20mbps here, but if I can pull anything better than about 10mbps I am going for it. That is a lofty goal for Sprint, but we are cord cutters and need the bandwidth. We are very close to a major interstate highway (lots of towers) and Sprint is based here so I will keep my fingers crossed.  
Thanks again!
