"Cogent (As 174) Pleas \[sic\] IPv6 Peer With Us xoxox HURRICANE ELECTRIC (AS6939)"

Heh. Via [NANOG](http://thread.gmane.org/gmane.org.operators.nanog/135707).  
  
Note: Paul Wall responds, reasonably: "along with the bad spelling, we have short memories.  peering is about mutual benefits. when benefits aren't there peering doesn't happen. going to nanog and yelling about peering by saying that you're a victim isn't a mutual benefit last i checked. their lack of peering doesn't demand another moment of our attention. choose wisely."  
  
UPDATE: HE provided this cake at the 2009 NANOG 47 meeting, in Dearborn, Michigan ([via](http://www.datacenterknowledge.com/archives/2009/10/22/peering-disputes-migrate-to-ipv6/)). At the link, Randy Epstein comments, "I ate the e! That cake was yummy. Thanks Mike." heh.
