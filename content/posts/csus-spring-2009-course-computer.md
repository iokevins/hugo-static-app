As I [mentioned in July 2008](http://schultkl.blogspot.com/2008/07/second-grad-school-hurdle-or-theres.html), my grad school plans have shifted out a bit. I plan to take CSC 137 this spring, then CSC 130 in the fall, get A's in both, then enroll in grad school in the spring of 2010. I was not able to fit in a class last fall due to work pressure.
