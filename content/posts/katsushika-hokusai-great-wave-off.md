From the New York City Metropolitan Museum of Art:  

> The Great Wave at Kanagawa (from a Series of Thirty-six Views of Mount Fuji), Edo period (1615–1868), ca. 1830–32  
> Katsushika Hokusai (Japanese, 1760–1849)  
> Japan  
> Polychrome woodblock print; ink and color on paper; 10 1/8 x 14 15/16 in. (25.7 x 37.9 cm)  
> H. O. Havemeyer Collection, Bequest of Mrs. H. O. Havemeyer, 1929 (JP1847)  
>   
> Description  
>   
> The preeminence of this print—said to have inspired both Debussy's "La Mer" and Rilke's "Der Berg"—can be attributed, in addition to its sheer graphic beauty, to the compelling force of the contrast between the wave and the mountain. The turbulent wave seems to tower above the viewer, whereas the tiny stable pyramid of Mount Fuji sits in the distance. The eternal mountain is envisioned in a single moment frozen in time. Hokusai characteristically cast a traditional theme in a novel interpretation. In the traditional "meisho-e" (scene of a famous place), Mount Fuji was always the focus of the composition. Hokusai inventively inverted this formula and positioned a small Mount Fuji within the midst of a thundering seascape. Foundering among the great waves are three boats thought to be barges conveying fish from the southern islands of Edo (modern Tokyo). Thus a scene of everyday labor is grafted onto the seascape view of the mountain.

We worked on it on and off over the course of several weeks. It's one of those projects where we went in ignorant, learning as we went. Once we invested the $40 in the foam core boards, we had a financial incentive to motivate us. And again once we used about $60 of color inkjet cartridges to print the panel-sheets (two at ~$28). We invested about $125 total. We live next to an artist who appraised it at about $500. o\_O We also felt confident the end product would look fantastic based on other images in the Rasterbator image gallery.  
  
So, these motivations helped balance out the tedious nature of taping, measuring, marking, fixing foam-core hangers, and so forth. Not completely--I'm not sure I'd do it again so soon. Then again, I feel the satisfaction of completing a tedious job that (in my opinion) looks wonderful.  
  
Hope that helps!
