Standing desk height roughly the same as my elbow height: 44 inches.  
  
To temporarily sit at that height (for me), a chair would need a seat height of approximately 36 inches.  
  
**Notes**  
  
[Hacker News discussion](http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=1518721) about various types of seating possibilities: lab stools, ironing chairs, bar stools, drafting chairs.  
  
[Barstools 4 U](http://www.barstools4u.com/extratall.htm) - great articles about what to look for. [Also, too](http://classic-web.archive.org/web/20070818202543/www.barstools4u.com/inf.htm).  
  
36 inch stools are also known as "spectator height stools".
