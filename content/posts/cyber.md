Etymology  
"Cyber- is derived from "cybernetic," which comes from the Greek word κυβερνητικός meaning _skilled in steering or governing_." ([via](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet-related_prefixes#.22Cyber-.22))  
  
History  
A brief history:  

*   Dr. Wiener coined the term "cybernetics" in the book, _Cybernetics or Control and Communication in the Animal and the Machine_ (MIT Press, 1948)

*   Used to refer "to the control of complex systems in the animal world and in mechanical networks, in particular self-regulating control systems"
*   Instigated by work on automatic aiming and firing of anti-aircraft guns

*   Cyborg, as a term, enters the public consciousness (1960's), as a shorthand for "cybernetic organism"
*   _Cyber_ supercomputers sold by CDC (1970's)
*   William Gibson publishes _Neuromancer_ (1980's), re-introducing cyber as a prefix, in popular press

Opinion

Not a fan of the term cyber, which seems a cliche. However, in the appropriate context, as shown above, I like it, as a term in the sense used by Dr. Wiener.
