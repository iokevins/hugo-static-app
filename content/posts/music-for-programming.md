"I've found Music for Programming's mixes to be pretty good.  
http://musicforprogramming.net/  
Dream Chimney's mixes on soundcloud also.  
https://soundcloud.com/the-dream-chimney  
In general, something classical, ambient, or minimal techno fits the bill."  
  
"Hope it's OK for me to take the chance to plug my own ambient noise mixing app:  
[http://asoftmurmur.com](http://asoftmurmur.com/)  
I find ambient noise (at a low, safe volume) to be helpful for concentration."  
  
"I use http://focusatwill.com/ and it helps increase my concentration."  
  
"http://noisli.com is really great. Mix your own ambient sounds."
