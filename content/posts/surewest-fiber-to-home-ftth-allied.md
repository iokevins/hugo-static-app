In August 2007, we switched to [Surewest Fiber](http://www.surewest.com/internet/highspeed.php) (18 Mbps down/up) for phone and internet connectivity.  
  
Surewest techs wall-mounted an Allied Telesis [AT-iMG646BD-ON](http://www.alliedtelesis.com/p-2196.html) Active Ethernet fiber intelligent Multiservice Gateway (iMG) on the side of our duplex:  

> "With full routing and multicast capabilities, the AT-iMG646BD simultaneously delivers high quality IP Video, up to four lines of VoIP, and differentiated data services over 10/100T x 6 ports.Security for the service provider and subscriber are ensured through stateful inspection firewall and NAT. The AT-iMG646BD-ON accelerates network convergence through proven interoperability with major softswitch vendors using MGCP, SIP, and H.323 VoIP protocols. Designed for one- or two phase-installation, the AT-iMG646BD-ON has integrated fiber drop cable termination and fiber splice protection. A single fiber uplink ensures efficient use of network infrastructure."
