The founders of SunRocket moved on earlier this year and Ms. Hook took over the helm. SunRocket has a ["Member Bill of Rights"](http://www.sunrocket.com/about/rights/) page that states:

> Dignity & Respect: You will be treated with the utmost dignity and respect in all dealings with SunRocket and company personnel.
> 
> Integrity & Trust: We endeavor to fully inform you of available options so you can make timely and informed choices. We will never abuse your trust through deceit, exploitation, neglect, manipulation, or discrimination

Goes to show the words in the contract only matter how well people adhere to them on any given day!
