The hinge repair seems like a common problem with this laptop. I used a soldering iron, per suggestion, to heat the metal, then gently pushed it down into the gap. I think I had the iron at 250 degrees Fahrenheit. Luckily, the original hinge screws still reached the metal and seem to secure the hinge.  
  
I tore the laptop down in order to see if any cat hair needed removal from the CPU fan. It turned out only a minor amount of hair seemed stuck. Cleaned it up and put it back together. Put all the screws in labeled baggies, which helped with putting it back together. Took about 60-90 minutes, in total, with the hinge repair.
