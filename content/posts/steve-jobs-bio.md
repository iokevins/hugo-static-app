Listening to an audio version of Walter Isaacson's biography on Steve Jobs (Dylan Baker, Narrator).  
  
NOTES  
  

*   Not a fan of Baker's voice
*   [Dave Winer](https://www.google.com/search?q=%22steve+jobs%22+isaacson+site:scripting.com) (some [balance](http://scripting.com/stories/2011/10/27/theJobsBook.html))

*   "Stross has the advantage of having already written a Jobs bio, while he was still at NeXT. It's the best tech book I've ever read."

*   [Narcissistic Personality Disorder](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Narcissistic_personality_disorder)Â (Tina Redse's theory)
*   Isaacson treats Bill Gates as though he may wish to write his biography someday (?)
