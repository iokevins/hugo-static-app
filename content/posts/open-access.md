Dawn subscribes to the [IEEE Transactions on Robotics (T-RO)](http://www.ieee-ras.org/publications/t-ro). This publication currently represents a hybrid journal, which means they allow publishers the option of choosing to use the "[Open Access](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_access)" model, to published articles.  
  
From the IEEE web site:  

> "For hybrid journals, the article processing fee is $1,750 plus other applicable fees (e.g. over-length article charges and color page charges). See individual journal author instructions for specific details." ([via](http://open.ieee.org/faq.html), retrieved Sep 13, 2015)
