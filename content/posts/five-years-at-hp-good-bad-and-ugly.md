**Five Years At HP -- The Good, The Bad, and the Ugly :)**

Note: these will likely only make sense to those who were there. I wrote these in 2005, after working five years at HP's Roseville facility, where we manufactured high-end supercomputers for North American region and the world. I am not sure I even remember the details of them all, anymore.  
  
The weirdest thing about leaving HP along with 15,000 others, that year: the concurrent e-mails prompting me to select a five-year HP Product Service Award Gift. :o) I still have the crystal  planar bowl, somewhere, in Wisconsin.

  

**First**: _The Bad and the Ugly_

*   Me: “Hey Darryl, I need one more code release, just one more man....” ;)
*   prdmbpa:/var/opt/bp/home/mbpbat DEFR
*   Andy Taff/Su Chu/and so forth: “Hey Kevin, I need a SolConfig set-up done by this afternoon for proto picks....” ;)
*   Suky: “Hey Kevin, can you help me out with these fifteen P1 BLT tickets in the queue?” ;)
*   You overpaid me by HOW much??? :P
*   Mostly irrelevant but compulsory organizational meetings ;)
*   Voice-mail: “Hi this is Kevin Schultz at the New HP....”
*   Bonuses section of Carly earnings announcement: “You’ve all worked very hard. However, <$lame\_excuse>”
*   (sfadmin:pts/0) cab01:/var/opt/sf/home/sfadmin/voltest/bin> ./VolTestMain -i2k
*   Order Execution team during ESG07a Rel 5: “Kevin, Frank wants to volume test some test picks tonight to test the backflush code, could you be available?” ;)
*   Houston folks, ESG07a Rel 5, one week into testing: “Hey Kevin, did we need to set-up inventory for test orders flowing through MBP?”
*   Operating on not enough sleep from the Houston hotel room during ESG07a Rel 5 volume testing: “Whoops, I just set all test orders in development backplane to BPCO.” x\_x
*   Roseville War Room during ESG07a Rel 5: co-worker starts singing (whining) along to music and not realizing it because music was turned up too loud.  Said person eventually ended up blowing out the iPod ear buds. :P
*   Overhearing Kurt’s daily soccer and on-line role-playing-game teleconference ;)
*   Don Bowen, talking to us in the RP cafeteria: “There’s a rumor they’re moving the factory to Houston....”
*   Cliff Henson, during site closure announcement, after answering 2 questions and telling people they just lost their jobs: “I think all your questions are answered on this handout and y’all should go back and read it.  Thank you.”
*   Dysfunctional management: Cliff Henson, Robert Sharpe, C. Kevin Harper, Charlie “The beatings will continue until morale improves” Baugh, David Witt (others....)
*   TeamPlayer (TimeWaster) 
*   Porting sfweb to Oracle (awk/sed/ksh/TCL/remsh/chicken-wire/weboor)
*   Non-productive interruptions inherent with cubicle office environment
*   Sean: Zebra printer noise -- \*whiiiiiine\* \*cut\*
*   HP laying off folks right before the winter holidays in 2002.
*   On the job for a week or two and watching security walk your co-worker/friend out the door. :P  (Yes, I know now why y’all fired him) ;)
*   Huddling around RP ceiling speakers to hear quarterly earnings announcements
*   Sitting across cubicle wall from Don Conner at RP and listening to him record voice-mail greetings until he got it right ;)
*   Robert Sharpe bringing the wireless telephone headset into the bathroom.  Wild.
*   That squeaky cart wheeled slowly down the hallway in R4.  \*squeak\* \*squeak\* \*squeak\*
*   The alarm bell of the door in the corner of R4 going off for 10 minutes. \*ringggggggggg\*
*   Cell-phone ring-tones going off for 30 seconds with no one around ;)
*   Piercingly shrill SAP support pager going off but slow response because the wearer wears headphones.  :P
*   Sitting across R4 cubicle wall from someone who hung their phone headset on the vertical cubicle connecter.  \*clink\* \*clink\* \*clink\* .... :P

**All's Well That End's Well: **_The Good_  

*   Kurt’s stories. “Party foul” :)  Also one of the few people I know to have a saying, “Pull a Kurt.” :)  Too much about Kurt to list here. “Dude!” ;)

*   Doug Walters: Duct tape :)
*   Mary Kay Kane yelling: “Hey everybody! .... Happy birthday, to you....”
*   The Phantom Glenn Thomas, for having a protocol regarding the invocation of his name. :)
*   Alex Ulbrich: stories about life as a private investigator, rolling out of a moving vehicle at night to gather intelligence on potential insurance abusers. LOL
*   Naeya: for her grace and for making fantastic Halloween costumes
*   Kathy: Standing up for me
*   Mike: TCL ;)
*   Mila Congrove (SI): Positive attitude and I loved her accent :)
*   Cecilia, Jackie, Chris, Terri, and Ken (Sodexho): Super bean and rice, or rice bowl with veggies.  And the black cook from RP who told me I could drive to LA on Hwy 99 in five hours.  Even after I tried it and failed to do so, he claimed he could do it. :)
*   Sodexho’s vanilla bean yogurt (my favorite)
*   Kris: battling through arm problems.  She had a note above her desk at RP quoting either Bill or Dave: “If anyone ships defective product to meet a deadline, I will personally fire them” (paraphrase).
