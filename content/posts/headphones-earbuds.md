"Focus on noise isolation. Using ER-4P ([https://www.etymotic.com/consumer/earphones/er4.html](https://www.etymotic.com/consumer/earphones/er4.html)) with triple-flange tips is about the best you can get. Better even than $1000+ customs (exception made for Noble silicon customs)."  
  
"I mostly have experience with Westone or Shure's, but I like Comply foam tips a lot better - more comfortable, anyway. Worth checking out.

Oh yeah those are really comfortable. I found they broke/wore out quickly though."  
  
"I have the same model (Bose QC20i). Ears do not get fatigued. Impressive technology to be honest, didn't think they were that effective before I used them. I do agree that it's not a solution, but probably the best way to adapt."
