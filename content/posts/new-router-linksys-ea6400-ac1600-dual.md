Due to hardware failure, yesterday we replaced our Linksys [WRH54G](http://www.linksys.com/us/support-product?pid=01t80000003KWYdAAO) Wireless-G Home Router (c. 2007) running [DD-WRT](https://dd-wrt.com/wiki/index.php/Linksys_WRH54G).

In its place, we installed the Linksys EA6400 AC1600 Dual-Band Smart Wi-Fi Router (c. 2013), a Costco purchase, for ~$90 (about $10 under the current Amazon price).

Note: read about Jeff Atwood's [Scooter Computer](https://blog.codinghorror.com/the-scooter-computer/) idea; tempted, but needed something immediately.  
  
The Linksys WRH54G failed, on the evening of Wednesday, April 6, 2016. Successfully accessed maintenance screens, via attached cat 5 cable. Discovered the saved MAC address whitelist filters completely cleared, which may represent one cause of wireless connectivity issues. In addition, the router became unresponsive, after several minutes of administrative screen operation, several times in succession. I abandoned it, at this point.
