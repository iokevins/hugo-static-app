A laptop purchase made in 2007 appears to have contained a pirated version of Windows Vista. Happily, Dawn purchased a copy of Windows XP last year through her community college for $25.  
  
Downgrading took a bit of effort. We used David Karp's advice ([http://www.pcmag.com/print\_article2/0,1217,a%253D226950,00.asp](http://www.pcmag.com/print_article2/0,1217,a%253D226950,00.asp)) to reset the Administrator password and fix the master boot record. XP's recovery console didn't recognize the Vista Administrator password though--to fix this we used ElderGeeks' advice on how to edit the registry to bypass the setting ([http://www.computing.net/answers/windows-xp/admin-password-in-recovery-console/156682.html](http://www.computing.net/answers/windows-xp/admin-password-in-recovery-console/156682.html)).  
  
Windows is dead, long live Windows.
