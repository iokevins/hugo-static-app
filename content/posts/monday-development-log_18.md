Monday:

1.  C++ introduced [references](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C%2B%2B#History) in 1983 (C lacks references--instead, C uses pointers to implement pass-by-reference).
2.  Compiling class SymbolStorage--on Tuesday I'll begin testing it thoroughly.
3.  [const\_cast](http://www.cppreference.com/keywords/const_cast.html) removes or adds the const label to a variable.
