Things change quickly. When I [last posted](http://schultkl.blogspot.com/2009/10/graduate-school-spring-2011.html) about grad school plans, I hoped to take CSC 139, Operating System Principles (3 units) at CSUS, MW 5:30-6:45 p.m., and CISP 453, Introduction to Systems Programming (4 units), at ARC, MW 10:30-11:50 a.m., and Lab from 12:00-1:20 p.m..  
  
Then CSUS canceled the MW 5:30-6:45 p.m. section of CSC 139, leaving section 1, TR 3:00-4:15 p.m.  
  
CSUS also canceled the MWF 4:00-5:10 p.m. section of STAT 50 (4 units). x\_x  
  
Also, an alternate class, CSC 132 - Computing Theory (3 units) TR 4:00-5:15 p.m., has been changed to TR 1:30-2:45 p.m.  
  
So, it appears my new schedule will be CSC 132 and CSC 139:  

1.  CSC 60 - Intro System Program Unix (3 Units)  
      
    

*   Spring 2010 TR 1:30-2:45 p.m. (Chung Wang)  
      
    

3.  CSC 132 - Computing Theory (3 Units)  
      
    

*   Spring 2010 TR 1:30-2:45 p.m. (Meiliu Lu)  
      
    

5.  CSC 139 - Operating System Principles (3 Units)  
      
    

*   Spring 2010 TR 3:00-4:15 p.m. (Du Zhang)  
      
    

7.  CISP 453 - Introduction to Systems Programming (4 Units)  
      
    

*   Spring 2010 MW 10:30-11:50 a.m. + Lab 12:00-1:20 p.m.. (Tak Auyeung)
