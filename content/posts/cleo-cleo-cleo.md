The [Cleo company's](http://cleo.com/) history seems to span four decades, multiple acquisitions, and a number of changes in hardware and software strategies.  
  
I think CLEO originally represented an acronym: “**CL**uster **E**nvironment **O**perator”\* . This seems to cross-check with the stylized trademark, below, which has separators between the letters, as “CL|E|O”. The CLEO software seems to have run on TurboDOS and does represent a play on the name [Cleopatra](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cleopatra#Etymology_of_the_name).  
  
ORIGINS  
  
From the publication “Kelly/Grimes IBM PC compatible computer directory”, c. 1985 ([link](https://books.google.com/books?id=JNJWAAAAMAAJ&q=cleo+%22phone+1%22&dq=cleo+%22phone+1%22&hl=en&sa=X&ei=6I65VLiABc6yogTf0IKABA&ved=0CEcQ6AEwBTge)):  

> “Phone 1 was incorporated in 1976 to manufacture voice data gathering systems, hence the name, Phone 1, Inc. Over the years a support staff of communications software specialists was assembled and software emerged as the forte. Although successful as a hardware manufacturer, Phone 1 directed its expertise to expanding the quality software programs available and so Phone 1 as a software house evolved.  
>   
> Today, Phone 1 has risen to the forefront in data communications through its offering of 327X and 3780 emulation programs. Its proprietary software, licensed under the trademark CLEO, has gained the approval of many major OEMs and is offered as a software/hardware package by several OEMs.”  
>   
> In a nutshell, CLEO products helped personal computers, workstations, and midrange computers to talk to IBM-compatible mainframes.
