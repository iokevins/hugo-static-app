Playing with KUbuntu and I accidentally deleted my task manager. All the icons on the widget bar's task manager went away, and all the other widgets flowed left.  
  
I re-added the task manager widget but it appeared on the extreme right, and there doesn't seem to be an easy way to rearrange them. :(  
  
The solution: remove everything, then re-add every widget in the correct order.  
  
A stiff penalty for an easy mistake.
