Seymour Cray, [1963](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parity_bit#History).  
  
Note: later, he stated, "I learned that a lot of farmers buy computers."  
  
Note: this use of the term seems to stem from a part of the New Deal, which aimed to pay subsidies to farmers, in exchange for not bringing their products to market. The idea: limit supply of certain farm products, drive up prices, and allow farmers to earn "parity" pay for their efforts, in comparison to other professions.
