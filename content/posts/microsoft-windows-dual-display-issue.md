At work, I have two displays: a primary, in portrait orientation, and a secondary, in landscape orientation.  

  

I use the former for text-intensive applications (for example, web browsing, coding) and the latter for spreadsheet and e-mail, typically.

  

A while back, I swapped primary and secondary, so primary was portrait and secondary was landscape.Â 

  

Today, returning from vacation, I decided I liked it better the other way, so I swapped them back.

  

Except my mouse pointer stopped at the left edge of the screen. Hrm. This stumped me for a moment...it's like coming back to a locker combination, in high school, after an absence.  
  
Google-fu saved the day: turns out I have to [re-arrange the physical position of the displays](https://superuser.com/questions/584697/how-to-permit-cursor-to-leave-left-side-of-screen-with-dual-monitors) in Microsoft Windows.
