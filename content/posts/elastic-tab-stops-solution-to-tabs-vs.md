Via Nick Gravgaard, circa 2006, by way of [Joel Spolsky](http://www.joelonsoftware.com/items/2006/07/03.html): A solution to tabs vs. spaces (?)

A definition of tab stops, from Wikipedia:

> "A tab stop on a typewriter is a location where the carriage movement is halted by mechanical gears. Tab stops are set manually, and pressing the tab key causes the carriage to go to the next tab stop. In text editors on a computer, the same concept is implemented simplistically with automatic, fixed tab stops. 

> Modern word processors generalize this concept by offering tab stops that have an alignment attribute and cause the text to be automatically aligned at left, at right or center of the tab stop itself. Such tab stops are paragraph-specific properties and can be moved to a different location in any moment, or even removed." ([Via](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tab_stop)) 

I am in agreement with Nick, regarding the larger context within which people present arguments for and against spaces and tabs: "The problem is that we're using tabs and spaces to format text for aesthetic reasons rather than treating them semantically - tabs are for indenting and aligning text, spaces are for separating keywords."  
  
That is, _semantics_ versus _aesthetics_. Sounds about right, to me. Nick seems to define tabs for indenting/aligning, and spaces for keyword separation. I use spaces, for both.  
  
Teaching myself about elastic tab stops has triggered a rethinking of habits around using tab stops. I can't remember the last time I used one. Maybe while using Microsoft Word? Years ago?  
  
Food for thought. [Discussion](https://www.google.com/search?q=site%3Anews.ycombinator.com+%22elastic+tabstops%22).
