Lots of fun (ha ha, joking) this evening installing a copy of Ubuntu to a Dell Inspiron 15r via USB:  

*   USB partition must be FAT16 to avoid boot failure
*   Use 1GB (of 8GB) partition to avoid weird "out of disk space" error when writing the ISO to the USB
*   Have to reinstall GRUB after the install

Oy.
