Boing Boing [linked](http://www.boingboing.net/2007/11/10/dvorak-funnies-expla.html) to a [Dvorak Zine comic](http://dvzine.org/zine/01-toc.html) today. I've used the [Dvorak](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dvorak_Simplified_Keyboard) keyboard layout since 2002. Here's how my personal experience compares to claims in the Dvorak Zine Comic:  

1.  It takes 52 hours to retrain

1.  Mostly true\--it took me about three eight-hour days, only 24 working hours, before I felt comfortable using Dvorak. I don't remember how long it took to reach my previous typing speed.

3.  50% increased accuracy

1.  Somewhat true\--although I doubt I've increased by 50%, and I have no data to back this up, I think I'm somewhat more accurate with Dvorak.

5.  20% increased typing speed

1.  Somewhat true\--I'm a bit faster now compared to QWERTY. I typed pretty fast with QWERTY though.

7.  Increased comfort and decreased likelihood of Repetitive Stress Injury (RSI)

1.  True\--Again anecdotal, but I think I've had fewer RSI issues since I adopted Dvorak.

Your mileage may vary--for me, the main advantages came with increased comfort and reduced RSI, something critical for someone spending 8-10 hours per day writing software.  
  
Some tips if you're willing and able to learn Dvorak:  

*   Commit to at least three days of learning Dvorak. It will try your patience while you retrain your muscle memory. Emotions may include frustration and fatigue.
*   Use Dvorak at home and at work while learning. I've found attempting to use different keyboard layouts during the initial phase counter-productive.
*   On Windows: [Ctrl-Shift](http://schultkl.blogspot.com/2006/08/ctrl-shift.html) to switch between QWERTY and Dvorak. This isn't well publicized, regrettably.
*   Expect to regress to hunt and peck on QWERTY keyboards you encounter in the wild after retraining. E.g., the public library, your friend's home, your significant other's PC, your co-worker's PC, your college computer lab. This is the biggest negative for me. I find I use Dvorak 99% of the time on a computer I have administrative control over, and these 1% cases don't matter much--again, your mileage may vary.

I learned something I didn't know from reading the comic this evening: on Linux, the command to set the keyboard map is: setxkbmap dvorak. Cool!  
UPDATE: What I didn't realize until I read through the comments on Boing Boing was how defensive people seem to feel about QWERTY versus Dvorak, probably because they feel judged.  
  
I think until keyboards come with letters that can be easily changed, QWERTY's here to stay.
