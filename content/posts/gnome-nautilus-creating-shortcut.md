In GNOME Nautilus, to create a shortcut to a file:  
  
Select the file  
Open theÂ context-sensitive menu (right-click with the mouse, or Shift+F10 on the keyboard)  
Select option Make Link  
  
Copy/move the newly created link to preferred location.  
  
Note: can also do via command line utility "ln".  
  
Works, as of Nautilus 3.14.1.
